# iptv-tests
A Python script to benchmark IPTV channel tuning performance. It uses VLC to accurately measure the time-to-video for M3U playlists, comparing direct vs. proxied streams. The script generates a detailed, color-coded HTML report with thumbnails to visually validate test results, helping you diagnose and optimize your IPTV setup.
